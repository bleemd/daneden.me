## Just My Type

[Just My Type](http://justmytype.co) is a library of font pairings from Adobe Typekit and H&FJ’s Cloud.Typography. Created out of a desire for a place to keep track of my personal favorite web font pairings, Just My Type has grown to become a popular typography resource for many web designers.

## Gateway

[Gateway](http://gateway-learning.com) is a proof-of-concept website designed to help migrant workers learn the vocational skills needed for them to get a job in the UK. Me, [Jon](http://twitter.com/JWalter14), and [Stacy](http://twitter.com/StaceSlater) built Gateway in collaboration with [Greenhat Interactive](https://twitter.com/ghinteractive) as part of our degrees.

I was responsible for the branding, design, and front-end development of Gateway. [Visit the site](http://gateway-learning.com).

## Onword

Tired of only being able to access my iA Writer documents on my iOS devices, I created [Onword](http://onword.co), a simple web application for writing documents. It was designed and developed in just 10 days, and introduced me to the world of Ruby.

## Webshaped 2012

I was invited to speak at this year's [Webshaped](http://webshaped.fi) conference, alongside some incredible folk I've long admired. It was terrifying, amazing, and I'd love to do it again. My presentation tackled animation on the web, and how we can delight our audience by integrating animation in our websites and applications. You can [read more](http://daneden.me/2012/05/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing/) about my time there. And that's not me up on stage in the picture - that's [Kyle.](http://twitter.com/kneath)

## Personal Branding

I recently [became an “adult”](http://daneden.me/twentyone), whatever that means. So I thought it was about time I got myself some business cards and establish some sort of personal branding. Rubber stamps are a relatively cheap way to instantly make handwritten letters a lot more fun.

## Brills

I designed and developed [Brills](http://brills.me) to quench my thirst for a simpler money management application that worked on all my devices, with a no-nonsense interface. I wrote it in vanilla PHP, before later discovering that CodeIgniter does a much better job than me at a lot of important stuff, and moving the code onto the framework with great ease.

## Animate.css

During the development of Brills, I found myself spending a lot of time writing CSS animation keyframes. It became quite a repetitive task, especially with the requirement for multiple keyframe declarations for different browsers. “There must be an easier way!” I cried, but there wasn't. So I made one.

[Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate) is a cross-browser plug-and-play CSS animation library for delightful animation in websites and web applications. [Visit the site](http://daneden.me/animate).
