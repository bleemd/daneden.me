				<p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
