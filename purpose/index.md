The purpose of this site has changed over the years.

In the beginning, it was a place for me to experiment with HTML and CSS, publishing my findings and keeping a log for myself. Since then, it has grown into a place for me to just *write*. About design, life, and my experiences.

One thing hasn’t changed; this site exists for me. My utility. A selfish endeavour, perhaps, but an important one. It has helped me grow as a designer and a human being. If it can do the same for you, I’ll be incredibly happy.
