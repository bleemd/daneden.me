This page exists for one purpose; to demonstrate the visual styles of the various elements that comprise the design of this site. This is not only for my own benefit, as the designer and maintainer, but also to satisfy the curiousty of those interested in such things (like myself).

As of today, September 9th 2013, the body text and first level headings are set in Mercury. *This is Mercury italic.* **This is Mercury bold.** For more information about the typographic decisions behind the design of this site, read [this post](/2013/10/17/read-all-about-it/).

> Blockquotes and other typographic elements besides the main body copy are often set in Whitney. Horizontal rules, like the one seen directly below this blockquote, are also set in Whitney.

## Heading Level Two
Secondary headings are set in Mercury, and tertiary headings are set in Whitney. [Hyperlinks](/styleguide) are underlined and colored red when hovered.

- Bulleted lists look like this.
- Multi-leveled bulleted lists look like this:
	- This is an example of a second-level bullet
- Lists tend not to be used very often on this site, but they exist nonetheless.

It would be precarious to design a bulleted list without preparing a numbered list styling.

### Heading Level Three
Just before we take a look at a numbered list, letâ€™s take a look at a third level heading. Like the second level heading, it is set in Whitney. Third level headings tend to be used to denote names rather than sections, so have a lower visual priority.

1. This is a numbered list.
2. Numbered lists can also have multiple levels:
	1. This is a second-level numbered list item
3. Numbered lists, like bulleted lists, are not used particularly often on this site.

Images are used sparingly, but must flow with the content. Captions should be readable, but not distract from the main article. Like images themselves, they are supplements.
