Find an object that hasn’t been manipulated by the human hand. If you’re sitting in a café or an office, at home or on a train, chances are you’ll find that a very difficult task.

Everything is designed. Every coin has been made a certain weight. Every spoon a certain size. Every shelf a certain depth. Every character in the text you’re reading a certain shape, or the sounds from your screen reader a certain timbre. But who makes these decisions, and why?

We all design. Every time we evaluate a tool or product, or think about how we might have done something differently, we are designing.

Hello. My name is Daniel Eden, and I am a Designer.
