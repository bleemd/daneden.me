title: Looking ridiculous for charity

[![Movember 2011](/uploads/2011/11/cover.png)](http://mobro.co/de)This year, I'm doing my part for charity by growing a mustache for Movember. It's a good cause, raising awareness and funding research into men's health, specifically testicular and prostate cancer.

This ought to be fun, since I look ridiculous with what little facial hair I can usually muster after a week, let alone a month.

Do your part and join in, or [sponsor me.](http://mobro.co/de) Thank you.
