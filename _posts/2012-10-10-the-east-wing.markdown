I had the great honour of being a guest on [Tim Smith](https://twitter.com/timothybsmith)'s podcast, [The East Wing](http://theeastwing.net/episodes/29-dan). Tim gave me a chance to talk about my side projects, and go into more detail about the ideas I spoke about in my [last blog post](http://daneden.me/2012/10/things-id-teach-my-younger-self-pt-2/).

[Go take a listen](http://theeastwing.net/episodes/29-dan).

While you're listening, you should support Tim's [Make Awesome project on KickStarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothybsmith/make-awesome-magazine). Make Awesome sounds like it'll be a great publication, but only with the support of the web community. Help a brother out!
