The always-brilliant Smashing Magazine gave me the opportunity to review their new book, [The Mobile Book](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/the-mobile-book.html). _TL;DR_ -- buy this book. It'll change the way you work.

I've not been on this planet for a very long time. Just about long enough to call myself a child of the Internet. I was there in the dial-up days of the 90's and early 2000's, when you'd have to kick me off the computer if you wanted to make a phone call. Then broadband came along; this changed everything. No more dial-up tone! (I actually miss the dial-up tone) No more crazy data-per-minute charges! Things were looking up.

Kb/s turned into Mb/s. Bandwidth limits turned from the megabytes to the gigabytes to unlimited. Meanwhile, mobile phones were crunching along on WAP internet connections. Even the "smartphones" suffered from poor data connections, and those lucky enough to connect to a WiFi network were redirected to m.example.com without even a thought.

Now look at us. We're streaming movies on these tiny computers that live in our pockets. We're playing games, reading articles, replying to emails, drafting blog posts, and so much more. The bottom line is, if you're not designing websites for mobile devices, you're not designing websites.



## Don't Panic


If you're anything like me, all this change has been overwhelming and terrifying. About a month ago, I found myself bolt upright in bed, worrying that I don't have the mobile design chops to keep up with the competition. Not to worry. Smashing Magazine have come along with a book made for you. It's called [The Mobile Book](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/the-mobile-book.html). And it's pretty bloody brilliant.

Some of the web's best minds---names such as Peter-Paul Koch, Trent Walton, and Brad Frost---have teamed together to bring you the vast wealth of their accrued knowledge, settling all your mobile-induced anxieties and letting you know that you're not alone. From an extensive overview of the widening mobile landscape and it's future, to responsive design strategies and UX tips that you can use today, this book is like the holy grail of modern web design. The techniques and methods covered in this book will go from rare to common practice and eventually to archaic, but the principles behind them will hold as long as our work is unfinished. And designers; our work is never finished.

I won't spoil the contents here. Every chapter is chock-a-block full of interesting information that'll change the way you work, and if you've ever read any of Smashing Magazine's other books, you know the high quality of standard to expect. From the very first chapter, this book changed the way I think about and approach my work. There's no doubt that The Mobile Book will become a worthy addition to my ever-growing bookshelf, and one that has in its short life offered me more practical, actionable, and valuable advice than the countless articles I come across every single day.

[Buy this book](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/the-mobile-book.html). You won't regret it.
