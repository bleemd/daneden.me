This week, I had the great privilege of attending this year's [New Adventures in Web Design Conference.](http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/) In three words, _it was amazing. _

It was the first conference I'd ever attended, and it was also the first time I'd met any other real life web designers. I finally met the people I'd spent the past year or so talking to, admiring, and working with on Twitter and other networks.

I met a whole bunch of amazing people - way too many to reel off without forgetting at least one. But you know who you were, and it was a real pleasure to meet you. I enjoyed all the talks, which were absolutely brilliant and inspiring. This certainly won't be my last conference, that's for sure.

Pictures say more than words, so that's all I'll say on the matter. I hope to meet more of you in the not-so-distant future!
