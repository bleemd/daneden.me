My name is Daniel Eden, and I'm a designer. I’m intrigued by the stories behind objects; how they were made, and who made them. I like to make [tools](/portfolio) for the web and [write](/blog) about design, courage, and lack thereof. I also like Disney, dogs, and looking up.

I’m currently working for [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) as a Design Intern. If you want to, you can view and download [my résumé](http://cl.ly/OlXO).

I say words on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_dte). I get design critique on [Dribbble.](http://dribbble.com/dte) I connect with my family on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/daniel.eden). I write code and put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/daneden). Nothing out of the ordinary.

I’m engaged to be married to the best [human being](http://twitter.com/iamemliy) I have ever known. We’re both from Manchester, UK. She likes horror movies. I don’t.
